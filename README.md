## 🧭 Background

🎓 Dual Master’s in History & Archaeology  
🔍 Spent 4 years digging into the past (literally)  
💻 Now retraining as a **COBOL developer** on **mainframe (z/OS)** systems

## ⚒️ Currently Learning

- COBOL (yes, really—and proudly)
- JCL, z/OS mainframe essentials
- SQL & databases
- Git / GitHub (versioning even prehistoric bugs)
- Teamwork, autonomy, and laser-sharp attention to detail

## 🕹️ Interests

- Retro video games 🎮  
- Vintage newspapers & historical artifacts 📰  
- Military history & war memoirs ⚔️  
- Balcony gardening 🌱 (yes, even developers need sunshine)

## 🤝 Let’s Connect!

Looking for a curious, committed, and unconventional profile to join your dev team? I dig old code like I once dug Roman ruins.
